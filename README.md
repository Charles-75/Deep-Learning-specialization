# Deep-Learning-specialization

This repository gathers all programming exercices from the Deep Learning specialization course available on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) and taught by the well famous Andrew-Ng, ex chief-scientist at Baidu and AI researcher.  
  
Those exercices have been done in Python using several data science libraries and frameworks such as numpy for matrix/vectors computations and tensorflow to build production neural network models.
